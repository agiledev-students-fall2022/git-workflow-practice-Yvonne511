# Agile Development & DevOps
## To Begin With...
[This article](https://www.synopsys.com/blogs/software-security/software-engineers-security/) I found is very interesting. It is about how to incorporate cybersecurity awareness in software enginnering, basically shifting responsibilties from a security group to more detailed delegates to testing and coding. *I think this is intereting* because it will lead to a paradigm shift in the responsibility and training of software engineers.

Rather than using a centralized administrative group controling security, software engineers can support security efforts from the bottom up. Software engineers know enterprise risk management and threat modeling to cooperate with the software security team. Performance and reliability is usually given a lot of consideration, security should be treated in the same way. Security should be incorporated as a property in the system, a necessary component in the engineering process, rather than a feature.
