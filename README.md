##To Begin With...
[This article](https://www.synopsys.com/blogs/software-security/software-engineers-security/) I found is very interesting. It is about how to incorporate cybersecurity awareness in software enginnering, basically shifting responsibilties from a security group to more detailed delegates to testing and coding. *I think this is intereting* because it will lead to a paradigm shift in the responsibility and training of software engineers.
